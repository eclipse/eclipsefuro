# µSpecs

µSpecs or muSpecs are the short notation format of furo FIDL. If you are just interested in protobuf as output, you can 
get very far with this format. If you need [**enums**](/docs/overview/enums/) you have add them in the standard spec, but are still able to work 
with the µSpec for the rest.

Our main goal is to keep the µSpecs as small/simple as possible.

The µSpecs specification was built to make rapid progress in the design of prototypes. 
However, it has now been shown that they can cover a very wide range of use cases.
