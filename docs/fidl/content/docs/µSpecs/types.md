# Anatomy of a type µSpec
The µType specs are regular yaml files.

The "type-object" contains 3 fields. The fields `type`, `fields` are mandatory, the field `target` is optional and autogenerated when ommited.

You can have as many type definitions per file as you want. It makes sense that you put types in a file, that belongs togehter. 



*File: muspec/sample.types.yaml*
```yaml
- type: 'sample.Sample #A sample type'
  fields:
    password: '* string:1 #The password.'
    username: '* string:2 #The username or email, or something to identify.'
    details: 'sample.Details:3 #Details.'
  target: sample.proto # this is "optional", if you omit this, Furo will use the package name (auth)

- type: 'sample.Details #A sample type'
  fields:
    birth_date: '* google.type.Date:1 #The birth date.'
    weight: '* number:2 #The weight.'    
    age: '- number:3 #Calculated field for displaying the age, because the calculations are very hard.'
  target: sample.proto 

```

## The type line

```yaml
- type: 'sample.Sample (ce) #A sample type'
  !___!  !___________! !__! !____________!
    |          |         |       |
    |      type name     |       |
    |                    |       |
    |                    |   description (recomended) begins with a #
    |                    |
    |   indicator to create a collection and or a entity for the type (optional)
    | 
    | 
field name of the type


```
### type name
is defined by package.Type

### Auto entity and collection generator
**(ce)** write a **c** to autogenerate the collection type and/or **e** to generate the entity type for this type.

Furo can generate specs for entities and collections. Entities and collections are usualy used in services as a response.
If the generated specs are not suitable enough for you, you always have the possibility to write response by yourself.

The generated specs are optimized for the usage with the furo client framework. Atain, you do not have to use the furo
client framework to work with furo fidls.

### description
It is a good practice to give a good description of the type. This description will go to the generated protos and other generates.

## Fields

In the "fields-object", what a surprise, you define the fields / attributes of a type.

```yaml
fieldname: '* string:2 #The description.'
!_______!  !_!!____!!_!!________________!
    |       |    |   |          |  
    |       |    |   |  description (recomended) begins with a #
 field name |    |   |   
            |    |  field id, indicated by a :   
            |    |  
            |   type  
            |     
       Indicator for required (*), readonly (-), repeated ([])

```

### fieldname
The name of the field

### indicator required
If the field is required, type in a *

### indicator readonly
If the field is readonly, type in a -

### indicator repeated
If the field is repeated, type in a []

### type
Types are the same like in protobuf

### field id
The field id must be unique, the generated protos use them too

### description
It is a good practice to give a good description of the type. This description will go to the generated protos and other generates.
