# Defining A Type

Furo types are organized in packages, you can have as many types per package as you want.

Lets do a simple example in µSpec and spec and see what the resulting proto will be. 
 
## Define the type in µSpec
The following example is a complete type definition. You can use every type from your specs and installed
dependencies. You do not need to import them. The imports are resolved and checked by Furo when you translate your µSecs to standard specs with the command `furo muSpec2spec`. 

*File: muspec/auth/auth.types.yaml*    
```yaml
- type: 'auth.Credentials #Credentials type for login.'
  fields:
    password: '* string:1 #The password.'
    username: '* string:2 #The username or email, or something to identify.'
    second_factor: 'string:3 #A second factor like TOTP.'  
```

It helps a lot to know the anatomy of a µSpec, [read more here](/docs/µSpecs/types/) 


## Define the type in standard spec
The standard specs have a much higher information density then the µSpecs. 
Furo will fill out as much as possible with good defaults by using the `.furo`  configuration file.

It helps a lot to know the anatomy of a standard spec, [read more here](/docs/specs/types/)

*File: specs/auth/Credentials.type.spec*
```yaml
name: Credentials
type: Credentials
description: Credentials type for login.
__proto:
    package: auth
    targetfile: auth.proto
    imports: []
    options:
        go_package: github.com/foo/bar/dist/pb/auth;authpb
        java_multiple_files: "true"
        java_outer_classname: AuthProto
        java_package: com.auth
fields:
    password:
        type: string
        description: The password.
        __proto:
            number: 1
            oneof: ""
        __ui:
            component: ""
            flags: []
            noinit: false
            noskip: false
        meta:
            default: ""
            hint: ""
            label: auth.Credentials.password.label
            options:
                flags: []
                list: []
            readonly: false
            repeated: false
            typespecific: null
        constraints:
            required:
                is: "true"
                message: password is required
    username:
        type: string
        description: The username or email, or something to identify.
        __proto:
            number: 2
            oneof: ""
        __ui:
            component: ""
            flags: []
            noinit: false
            noskip: false
        meta:
            default: ""
            hint: ""
            label: label.Credentials.username
            options:
                flags: []
                list: []
            readonly: false
            repeated: false
            typespecific: null
        constraints:
            required:
                is: "true"
                message: username is required
    second_factor:
        type: string
        description: A second factor like TOTP.
        __proto:
            number: 3
            oneof: ""
        __ui:
            component: ""
            flags: []
            noinit: false
            noskip: false
        meta:
            default: ""
            hint: ""
            label: label.auth.Credentials.second_factor
            options: null
            readonly: false
            repeated: false
            typespecific: null
        constraints: {}
```

## Resulting proto from the type definition
```proto
// Code generated by furo-proto-gen. DO NOT EDIT.
syntax = "proto3";
package auth;
option go_package = "github.com/foo/bar/dist/pb/auth;authpb";
option java_multiple_files = true;
option java_outer_classname = "AuthProto";
option java_package = "com.auth";



// Credentials type for login.
message Credentials {

    // The password.
    string password = 1;

    // The username or email, or something to identify.
    string username = 2;

    // A second factor like TOTP.
    string second_factor = 3;
}
```

## Specifying Field Types
Use the [scalar value types](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#scalar) from proto3 or types
that you have defined or installed.

{{< hint danger >}}
You have always to write the package name  (**package.Type**) too , when you plan to use the furo client framework, even when you are on the same file.
{{< /hint >}}

### Packages and Name Resolution
[Like in protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#packages_and_name_resolution) the type 
name resolution works like C++: first the innermost scope is searched, then the next-innermost, and so on, with each package considered to be "inner" to its parent package. A leading '.' (for example, **.foo.bar.Baz**) means to start from the outermost scope instead.


 

## Field IDs
The field IDs are also used for the generated protos as [field numbers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#assigning_field_numbers). 

## Reserved Fields
There is no concept for reserved fields at the moment.
